                                <p>I am an application developer who has around two years of experience in web development, 
                                    primarily working with standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                                    I have basic familiarity with frontend frameworks (e.g., VS code) and some backend knowledge, using Node.js and IntelliJ. 
                                    While I am still building my expertise, I have a foundational understanding of the development lifecycle, including designing simple interfaces, coding, and testing. 
                                    My limited experience means I may require mentorship or guidance to tackle complex projects, but I am eager to learn and expand my skill set in web development.</p>

                                        <p>I am a novice in application development; however, I reap numerous benefits from what I learn.
                                        However, in terms of myself, there are some shortcomings — errors that cannot be overlooked. 
                                        One can find those who scrutinize and analyze the flaws, focusing on areas where improvements could be made.
                                        There is some emphasis on the challenges I face. These criticisms often highlight issues that I may downplay,
                                        but they are essential to address for growth. By facing these concerns rather than ignoring them, I can align 
                                        my goals with meaningful improvement and greater satisfaction for all involved.</p>
